### Microsoft Academic Alliance

If you are enrolled in a computer science course, you are eligible to obtain many

Visual Studio, SQL Server, Windows Server, Visio, and others. You can install these tools
on a laptop or home computer.

help desk creates your account, you will be able to log into the
